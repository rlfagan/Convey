# Roadmap

These are the features and integrations that we're planning to work on.

* [x] Consul - custom integration (remove the no longer support Consul package)

* [x] Outbox - implement the outbox pattern in a separate package

* [ ] RabbitMQ - improve the actual implementation using native client, including the support for queue retry, proper handling of connections, and parameters abstraction.

* [ ] Service Mesh - integration with Consul Connect, Envoy and other proxies/sidecars.
